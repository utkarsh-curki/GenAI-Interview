# GenAI Internship Assignment

## Assignment Title
*Data Extraction and Population Task*

---

## Objective
To evaluate your ability to work with structured data, extract relevant information, and populate a predefined template file while preserving its original structure and format.

---

## Problem Statement
You are provided with:

1. A *template file* (e.g., CSV or Excel)
2. A *source data files* (e.g., multiple CSV or Excel)

Your task is to:

- Use AI to extract required data from the source files
- Populate the data into the template file
- *Maintain the exact structure* of the template — including column order, formatting, headers, and any blank or reserved fields

⚠️ *Deviation from the template structure will result in evaluation penalties.*

Note: You are free to use any tool, language, approach and LLM's

## System Capability Overview

The system must be capable of accurately populating any provided template file (in Excel or CSV format) using one or multiple source files (also in Excel or CSV format). This process should be powered by AI/GenAI or intelligent software logic.

The solution must be dynamic and adaptable, meaning it cannot rely on hardcoded mappings or assumptions. It should intelligently interpret the structure and content of both the template and source files to perform accurate data population, regardless of the specific format or content of the files provided.
